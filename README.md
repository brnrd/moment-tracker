# Moment Tracker

A small, minimalist **moment tracker** built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Astro](https://astro.build), just for fun.

It lets you mark meaningful life events — like quitting a habit, starting a relationship, or any personal milestone — and shows you how much time has passed since.

## Features

- Add multiple moments with a label, date, and optional time
- Shows elapsed time in years, months, and days
- Share or import (override or merge) your data via a single encoded string
- Light/dark theme (system or user preference)
- Logical/EU/US date format toggle

No backend, no tracking, no bloat. Just local storage and a shareable string.

## Tech

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- No UI framework or CSS libraries

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
